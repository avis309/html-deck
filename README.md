# HTML Deck

**A visual editor for the HTML files in your workspace: slide decks, reports, and pages written by
you or by an AI agent.**

Click text to edit it, restyle it, move blocks, add effects and present. The file is patched
**only where you changed it**, so a save with no edits is byte-identical.

## Why

- **Edits stay minimal.** HTML Deck patches the source text where you made a change and leaves
  everything else as it was, including formatting, comments and the agent's own markup. That keeps
  diffs small and reviewable.
- **Works with your agent.** Pin a note on any element ("make this shorter"), or drag across a slide
  to sweep several blocks and leave one note for the area, then ask Claude Code or Codex to apply
  your HTML Deck notes. The agent reads them, edits the HTML and marks them done.
- **Presents the real thing.** Presentation runs the deck's own scripts and animations in a
  separate frame, so presenting never touches the document you are editing.
- **Local and dependency-free.** One Python 3.11+ standard-library server on `127.0.0.1`. Nothing
  leaves your machine.

## Install

| Where | Command |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | `/plugin marketplace add avis309/html-deck` then `/plugin install htmldeck@htmldeck` |
| Codex | `codex plugin marketplace add avis309/html-deck` then `codex plugin add htmldeck@htmldeck` |
| uv | `uvx htmldeck` (one-off) · `uv tool install htmldeck` |
| pipx / pip | `pipx install htmldeck` · `pip install htmldeck` |
| npm | `npx @avis309/htmldeck` (one-off) · `npm i -g @avis309/htmldeck` |

HTML Deck needs Python 3.11+ and nothing else. The npm package and the plugins find Python and run
it for you. It works on Linux, macOS and Windows.

## Use it with an agent

In Claude Code or Codex:

1. Ask the agent to open your HTML file in HTML Deck, e.g. *"open my deck in HTML Deck"*. Claude
   Code also has `/htmldeck [file]`.
2. Edit in the browser, and pin **AI Feedback** notes where you want the agent to change something.
3. Ask the agent to *"apply my HTML Deck notes"*.

## Run it yourself

```bash
htmldeck                                # workspace = current folder
htmldeck --file <file>.html             # open that document first
htmldeck --root <folder> --port 6789 --no-browser
```

`<file>.html` is any HTML document in your workspace: a deck, a report, a page.

To try it on the sample deck (a 17-slide quarterly marketing report with anime.js charts) in a
clone of this repo, run `htmldeck --root samples --file marketing-report.html`. The same folder
has `architecture.html`, a page with an SVG diagram whose labels you can edit.

The workspace is the folder HTML Deck runs in, or the folder given with `--root`. Every path is
relative to it, and nothing outside it is served or written, except the file passed with `--file`.
Each save keeps a timestamped backup in `.htmldeck_bak/` next to the document.

**Save ▾** also saves a copy of the document to share:

- **HTML**: a single file that includes all its images, styles, scripts and fonts, so it opens
  anywhere, even offline. Resources loaded from the web (a CDN script, web fonts) are included
  too, unless you clear that option. From a terminal, run
  `python -m htmldeck.export --file <file>.html --remote`.
- **PDF**: the document as a PDF file: a deck, a report or any page.

Review notes live beside each document in `.htmldeck_notes/<name>.json`. Scripts and agents read
and resolve them with:

```bash
htmldeck-notes --file <file>.html             # list open notes
htmldeck-notes --file <file>.html --prompt    # the same, as a request ready to paste to an agent
htmldeck-notes --file <file>.html --done <id> # mark one done
```

A region note (drag from the slide background to select several blocks, then **AI Feedback** on
the group's toolbar) also records the area in CSS pixels of its slide or section and the elements
in it. Versions before 0.1.1 read it as a
note on the whole slide, and drop the region if they rewrite the notes file.

## What it supports

| | |
|---|---|
| 🌐 **Languages** | The whole editor speaks **English**, **Tiếng Việt**, **简体中文** and **繁體中文**. It follows your browser's language on the first visit (`zh-TW`, `zh-HK` and `zh-Hant` open in Traditional Chinese, with Taiwan wording); switch any time from the language menu. |
| 📄 **Documents** | Plain HTML pages and reports, and decks of `.slide` blocks, whether written by you or generated by an AI agent. |
| 🎞️ **Reveal.js** | Hand-written Reveal.js decks: vertical stacks, fragments, speaker notes and backgrounds. Reveal's Markdown slides are read-only. |
| 🎨 **Tailwind CSS** | Utility classes are kept as written. Your restyling is applied on top as the element's own style, and wins even over `!important` utilities. With the Tailwind Play CDN (`cdn.tailwindcss.com`), the editor tells you to trust the file so the edit view is styled too; presenting always is. |
| 📐 **SVG diagrams** | Click a label in an inline `<svg>` (a `<text>` or `<tspan>`) and type over it; only that text changes in the file. Click a shape to select the whole diagram, for example to pin AI Feedback on it. |
| ✨ **Animations & effects** | The deck's own animation code (anime.js, GSAP, CSS animations…) runs when presenting and is frozen while editing; code registered as a *scene* is also restarted each time its slide is shown. `data-fx` entrance effects (fade, zoom, slide, count-up) can be set from the toolbar; "Enable FX in the file" adds a small inline runtime so they run when the file is opened on its own. |
| 🛟 **Safe editing** | Content that the page's own scripts create or change is locked, and the editor shows why. Undo/redo, draft recovery, and a timestamped backup on every save. |
| 🔒 **Isolation** | Presentations run on a second origin with no access to the editor's API. The edit view blocks remote scripts (from a CDN, for example) unless you trust the file. A file opened from your computer instead of the workspace runs none of its own scripts. Workspace files opened directly on the editor origin are sandboxed. |

```bash

npm install
npm run check        # eslint (editor modules) + pytest (server) + browser spec
```

- `htmldeck/server.py`: HTTP server, workspace guards, save/backup/notes API, preview origin.
- `htmldeck/web/`: the editor, as native ES modules with no bundler. `js/core` holds the model,
  serializer and history; `js/runtime` holds provenance and motion freeze; also `js/policy`,
  `js/formats` (Reveal), `js/present` and `js/fx` (the effects runtime, which is also inlined
  into documents).
- `tests/spec/characterization.spec.mjs`: black-box Playwright spec over fixtures in a temporary
  workspace. To run it on another workspace's files too:
  `HTMLDECK_REAL_ROOT=… HTMLDECK_REAL_FILES="a.html,b.html" npm run spec`.
- `tools/align-report.mjs`: `npm run align -- <workspace>` reports what share of a workspace's
  HTML files save as an in-place patch. The rest still save correctly, through a full rewrite that
  the editor asks you to confirm.
- Plugin: `.claude-plugin/`, `.codex-plugin/`, `.agents/plugins/` (marketplaces),
  `skills/htmldeck/` (also the `/htmldeck [file]` command), and `scripts/htmldeck-run[.cmd]`, which runs this copy with any
  Python 3.11+.
- npm wrapper: `packaging/npm/` bundles `htmldeck/` at pack time and runs it with the user's
  Python.
- Release: run `python tools/bump_version.py X.Y.Z`, commit, then tag `vX.Y.Z` and push the tag.
  `.github/workflows/release.yml` publishes to PyPI, then npm, then creates the GitHub Release.
